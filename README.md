# Course_work_NN
The course work contains several variants of convolutional Neural Neural network to distinguish emotions on an image.

main.ipynb  - initial
It contains one very simple network with no adds with vizualization of training loss. Also it contains one more deep neural network with droupout layer at the end.

main2.ipynb
It contains convolutional NN with augmentation

main3.ipynb
It contains fine-tuned model, basing on VGG with resnet weights

main4.ipynb
It contains valence-arousal aproach.
Given data was annotated by myself basing on the common graph.

main4_2.ipynb
It contains model firstly trained on emotic dataset, annotated with valense-arousal targets.
Then model applied on our given dataset.
